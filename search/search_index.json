If you can touch and see it, it is material culture. Some examples include clothing, goods, tools, buildings, and places of worship. </p> <p>Cultural Landscape: the ways that a cultural group modifies their environment. Material culture put together makes up the cultural landscape. Mentifacts or Sociofacts: The opinions, beliefs, and ideas that make up a culture. (Think \u201cmental facts\u201d or \u201csocial facts\u201d -- stuff that people in that culture think is true.) </p> <p>Sense of Place: a set of qualities and characteristics that make a specific geographic location different from everywhere else. </p> <p>Placelessness: when a place lacks qualities and characteristics that make it distinct from other geographic locations </p> <p>Ethnocentrism: judging another culture by your own standards </p> <p>Environmental Determinism: the assumption that culture is determined exclusively by physical environment. This belief is outdated, and it was often applied in a racist way toward non-European cultures. </p> <p>Cultural Relativism: a person\u2019s beliefs and behaviors should be judged in terms of their own culture </p> <p>Environmental Possibilism: the belief that physical environment is one among many factors that shape the development of a culture. </p> <p>Dialect: a regional, racial, or socioeconomic variation in how a language is spoken (British English v American English). People who speak dialects of the same language would be able to communicate easily, even if they found each other\u2019s slang confusing. </p> <p>Language Family: a group of languages that share a common origin. Languages in the same family might have some similar grammar and vocabulary, but not always enough to hold a conversation (think Spanish and English), or they might be so distantly related that only a specialist could realize what they have in common (English &amp; Bengali). </p> <ul> <li> <p>Indo-European Language Family: the largest language family in the world. It makes up 46% of modern languages, including English, most languages spoken in Europe, and most languages spoken on the Indian subcontinent </p> </li> <li> <p>Sino-Tibetan Language Family: the second largest language family in the world. It makes up approximately 20% of modern languages in the world, including most </p> </li> </ul> <p>Language Branch: a closely related group of languages from one family. Branches of the same family might have enough in common to enable a basic conversation. For example, a fluent Spanish speaker who goes to Portugal can probably buy train tickets or read simple announcements, but not negotiate a business deal. </p> <p>Isogloss: a line on a map showing where a language is spoken </p> <p>Lingua Franca: a common language that is spoken between people who do not speak one another\u2019s language </p> <p>Pidgin: an informal language that is made up of two languages, like Spanglish. \u201cInformal\u201d means that it is not recognized as an official language of any culture or country, and it has no rules for grammar, spelling or vocabulary. Different speakers will combine Spanish and English in different ways. </p> <p>Creole: a formal language that developed by combining two or more languages. Unlike pidgin, Creolized languages have recognized rules for grammar, spelling, and vocabulary. They may be official languages of whole countries. </p> <p>Centripetal Force: a force that can help unify a country </p> <p>Centrifugal Force: a force that can tear a country apart </p> <p>Sacred Site / Sacred Place: a specific geographic location that is thought to have a special connection to a god or god(s) </p> <p>Place of Worship: a place where religious services are conducted, such as a church, temple, mosque, or shrine. </p> <p>Ethnic Religion: a religion that is practiced exclusively or nearly exclusively by members of a specific ethnic group. </p> <p>Universalizing Religion: a religion that attempts to appeal to all people across many ethnic groups and geographic areas </p> <p>Syncretism: when one religion combines or modifies ideas from another religion (In Latin, Syn = together and cret = belief, so syncretism is putting together beliefs from different religions)</p>"},{"location":"Freshmen%20Year/AP%20Human%20Geography/Semester%202/Semester%202/","title":"Semester 2","text":"<p>![[HuG Spoons.pdf]]</p> <p>![[Important Concepts &amp; Maps.pdf]]</p> <p>![[Political Geography Vocabulary.pdf]]</p> <p>![[Religion.pdf]]</p> <p>![[Rural_Urban Vocab Review List.pdf]]</p> <p>![[Vocab MasterList.pdf]]</p>"},{"location":"Freshmen%20Year/English%20Honors/Vocabulary/","title":"Vocabulary","text":""},{"location":"Freshmen%20Year/English%20Honors/Vocabulary/#lesson-1","title":"Lesson 1","text":"<p>Ambiguous adjective 1. open to or having several possible meanings or interpretations;equivocal: an ambiguous answer.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Linguistics.
