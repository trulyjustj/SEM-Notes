## Circular Motion

Equation Used For Circular Motion
$$ \sum F_c = ma_c $$
- Where $\sum F_c$ is the Net Force of all the forces.
- Where $a_c$ is the Centripetal Acceleration

Further the Equation To Get:
$$ \sum F_c = m \frac {v^2}{r} $$
- The Force in the direction of the Center of the Circular motion is the Positive Force in the Equation (Usually the largest force).

Force of Gravity equation for Space Problems
 $$ F_g = \frac{GMm}{r^2} $$
 - Where $G$ is the Gravity of the Bigger Space Object
 - Where $M$ is the mass of the Bigger Space Object
 - Where $m$ is the mass of the satellite orbiting the Bigger Space Object
 - Where $r$ is the Radius

Velocity Equation for Circular Motion
 $$ V = \frac{2\pi r}{T} $$
