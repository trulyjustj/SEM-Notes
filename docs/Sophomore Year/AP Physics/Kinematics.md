### Key Takeaways
- Slope of Position V.S. Time Graph is Velocity
- Slope of Velocity V.S. Time Graph is acceleration
- Curves on Position V.S. Time Graph means there is acceleration
- X-Intercept on Velocity V.S. Time graph means change in Direction
- Slope gets Flatter on Position V.S. Time Graph, then its slowing down
- Slope gets Steeper on Position V.S. Time Graph, then its speeding up

### Important Information
- Identical Objects = Same Mass
- Magnitude = Size of Absolute Value
- Net Force is $\sum F=ma$
- Speed: #, no direction
- Velocity: #, +/- direction
### Linearization
