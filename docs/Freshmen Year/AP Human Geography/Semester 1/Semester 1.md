## Unit 1: Introduction to Geography 

**Absolute location:** an exact site that can be located on an objective coordinate system, such as a street address or latitude/longitude. 

**Absolute distance:** A precise physical measurement between one place and another, such as centimeters or kilometers 

**Relative location:** an approximate location of a site based on its distance from other physical landmarks. 

**Relative distance:** an approximate measurement between one place and another, often based on travel time 

**Scale:** how close the map “zooms in” on a piece of land. In other words, what level of detail you can see on the map. 

**Clustered:** items sharing a specific characteristic are located close together 

**Dispersed:** items sharing a specific characteristic are scattered far apart 

**Density:** the number of items in a specific geographic area. If items are clustered, the density will be high. If they are dispersed, the density will be low. 

**Urban:** located in cities 

**Rural:** located in the countryside Suburban: located in small towns that are found on the edges of big cities (for example, Plano and DeSoto are suburban areas around Dallas) 

**Reference Map:** a map that shows physical features such as streets, borders, or land forms 

**Thematic Map:** a map that shows a specific characteristic, such as life expectancy, crime rates, languages spoken, etc. 

Thematic maps come in lots of flavors, but two main ones are: 

- Choropleth Map: a map that color codes specific geographic units such as zip codes, counties, states, or countries according to a characteristic 
- Isoline Map: a map that uses colored bands to show a characteristic, and the bands cut across geographic units like zip codes, counties, states, etc. If that sounds weird, just picture a weather map. 

**Geospatial technology:** technology for measuring and mapping the earth’s surface. Today, most of this is done by GPS, or global positioning satellites. 

**Base Map:** the “bottom layer” of a thematic map, which shows physical features or boundaries. This map is made by geospatial technology like a GPS satellite. 

**Geographic Information System (GiS):** software that can store, combine, manipulate and analyze many types of data for display on a map. In other words, the GiS contains the information needed to create a thematic map. 

**Layers:** data added to a map to show thematic information, such as crime rates, life expectancy, language spoken, etc. 

**Hearth:** the point of origin for a new belief, idea, product, food, etc. 

**Diffusion:** the spread of a belief, idea, product, food etc. from one place in the world to another. 

**Relocation Diffusion:** something spreads because people move from one place to another. 

**Expansion Diffusion:** the spread of a belief, idea, product, food, etc. to a LARGER GROUP of people in the world. 

**Hierarchical Diffusion:** the spread of an innovation from an elite person or place to “regular” people and places. 

**Contagious Diffusion:** the rapid spread of an innovation across the entire population at once. 

**Stimulus Diffusion:** when a group of people adapts or modifies an innovation from another cultural or geographic group. 

**Distance Decay:** the more distant two places are, the less likely they are to interact and share ideas 

**Space-Time Compression:** the increasing connection between distant places due to improvements in transportation and communication technology

**Market:** any place where goods are bought and sold. 

**Footloose Industry:** an industry that does not need to be located near raw materials. Many tech firms are footloose -- for example, Apple could manufacture cell phones almost anywhere, because the raw materials to assemble them are not heavy or difficult to move. 

**Just in Time Delivery:** a management system that delivers goods exactly when they are needed, so that businesses do not have to waste money stockpiling a large inventory 

**Agglomeration:** when multiple businesses in the same industry are clustered together to access customers, resources, or supply chains. Think about all the clothing stores grouped in a mall.

## Unit 4 Culture

**Culture:** the characteristics, beliefs, and knowledge unique to a group of people, including language, religion, food, social habits, and arts. 

**Material Culture:** the physical objects that make up a culture. If you can touch and see it, it is material culture. Some examples include clothing, goods, tools, buildings, and places of worship. 

**Cultural Landscape:** the ways that a cultural group modifies their environment. Material culture put together makes up the cultural landscape. Mentifacts or Sociofacts: The opinions, beliefs, and ideas that make up a culture. (Think “mental facts” or “social facts” -- stuff that people in that culture think is true.) 

**Sense of Place:** a set of qualities and characteristics that make a specific geographic location different from everywhere else. 

**Placelessness:** when a place lacks qualities and characteristics that make it distinct from other geographic locations 

**Ethnocentrism:** judging another culture by your own standards 

**Environmental Determinism:** the assumption that culture is determined exclusively by physical environment. This belief is outdated, and it was often applied in a racist way toward non-European cultures. 

**Cultural Relativism:** a person’s beliefs and behaviors should be judged in terms of their own culture 

**Environmental Possibilism:** the belief that physical environment is one among many factors that shape the development of a culture. 

**Dialect:** a regional, racial, or socioeconomic variation in how a language is spoken (British English v American English). People who speak dialects of the same language would be able to communicate easily, even if they found each other’s slang confusing. 

**Language Family:** a group of languages that share a common origin. Languages in the same family might have some similar grammar and vocabulary, but not always enough to hold a conversation (think Spanish and English), or they might be so distantly related that only a specialist could realize what they have in common (English & Bengali). 

- **Indo-European Language Family:** the largest language family in the world. It makes up 46% of modern languages, including English, most languages spoken in Europe, and most languages spoken on the Indian subcontinent 

- **Sino-Tibetan Language Family:** the second largest language family in the world. It makes up approximately 20% of modern languages in the world, including most 

**Language Branch:** a closely related group of languages from one family. Branches of the same family might have enough in common to enable a basic conversation. For example, a fluent Spanish speaker who goes to Portugal can probably buy train tickets or read simple announcements, but not negotiate a business deal. 

**Isogloss:** a line on a map showing where a language is spoken 

**Lingua Franca:** a common language that is spoken between people who do not speak one another’s language 

**Pidgin:** an informal language that is made up of two languages, like Spanglish. “Informal” means that it is not recognized as an official language of any culture or country, and it has no rules for grammar, spelling or vocabulary.
